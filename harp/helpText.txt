Welcome to the electronic harp. This program allows you to play a harp interface of six sensors connected to an arduino.  The values on the left allow you to change the type of sound created by the arduino, whilst the values on the right allow you to change the note to be played. The values on the left can be floats or ints whilst the values on the right can be frequencies (ints) or notes (strings).  To start the instrument press start, to stop, press stop. To view the raw data coming from the sensor, click Raw Range. For any suggestions or complaints, email JTRollinson@gmail.com
